# Color Seeker game
### Tile-based platformer coded using Python's Arcade library!

This game is a passion project that came about after hours of indulging in a variety of hobbies, including drawing, painting, coding in Python, watching tech videos on Youtube, and playing instruments. After some time of thinking, "what can I do that allows me to combine most my interests into one workable package?" I decided that I could work on a simple 2D platformer game! It's simple, really: there is code to be written, assets to be rendered, sounds to be created, and levels to be designed! To combine most of my interests into one, this should be fun.

The name "Color Seeker" is a working title. It is a hint to what the gameplay will be like in the future. 

Color Seeker is coded in Python 3.8 primarily using the Arcade module. The structure of the code is Object-Oriented with Player, Window, View and Game objects. 

Here's a quick screenshot of how it looks as of early October:
